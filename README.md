# WinRing0
Collection of WinRing0 source code, including the slighly rare code for the driver component itself.

Very popular driver, used in a lot of applications centered around low-level hardware control, with OpenHardwareMonitor (and its fork LibreHardwareMonitor) being amongst the most popular.
One of the reasons for its popularity is due to it being signed. Bear that in mind before you start modifying the driver code here.

Uploading because I think it's worth archiving. The code, BSD-licensed, belongs to OpenLibSys.org. Do not send pull requests.
